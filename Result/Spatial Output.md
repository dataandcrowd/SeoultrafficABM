## Spatial Output
The maps below shows the average and maximum PM<sub>10</sub> concentrations by an hourly aggregation on the 2nd of January, 2018. The background PM<sub>10</sub> maintained between 30 and 60µg/m<sup>3</sup> in the morning rush hours from 5am to the early afternoon hours, although the 01:00 was quite unusual. While the background PM<sub>10</sub> showed a small difference between the average and maximum, the figures in the maximum roadside was twice as higher than the average. The average PM<sub>10</sub> was ranged between 60-90µg/m<sup>3</sup> before noon, particularly at *Sejong daero (near Kyongbok Palace)*, *Jongno*, and *Samil daero*. However, the maximum PM<sub>10</sub> shows that all the roads had experienced over 60µg/m<sup>3</sup>, and the junctions in larger roads (Daero) have exceeded 90µg/m<sup>3</sup> during rush hours. It is carefully speculated that the junctions produce more PM<sub>10</sub> from the frequency of the driver's ac/de-celeration behaviour. According to this model, PM<sub>10</sub> can possibly go up to 300µg/m<sup>3</sup> by a minute scale.


Looking closer to a specific time, 10:00am on January the 2nd, there was a spatial variation on PM<sub>10</sub> in the CBD. Jongno and Samil were compared. Jongno is a 8-lane road that has inbound vehicles from the east and west. It is situated far from the junction but selected because a monitoring station was installed. Samil is a junction that expects inbound vehicles from the south. In the time-series plot, the difference between the two stations was observed in the average levels 왜냐하면 많은 차량들이 지나가는 시기에는 그 수치가 비슷하지만 러시아워가 지나가더라도 삼일대로에는 지속적인 차량통행이 있는 반면 종로지역에는 그것보단 조용했기 때문이다.

평균치를 살펴보면, 100µg/m<sup>3</sup>을 넘는 기간도 종로는 이틀, 삼일은 닷새로 차이가 있으며 1월초순의 평균 PM<sub>10</sub>이 50-75µg/m<sup>3</sup> 사이에 머무른 데 반해, 종로는 25-60µg/m<sup>3</sup> 사이에 분포하였다. 그래서 같은 날이라도 종로측정소 주변으로 통근하는 사람들의 건강 위해도가 삼일대로보다 낮을 수 있다는 것이며, 조금 더 확장하면 차량들이 감/가속할 가능성이 많은 교차로 지역 주변으로 다닐시에는 각별한 주의가 필요하다.
