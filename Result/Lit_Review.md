## Non-Exhaust Road Emission and Health

### A concept for reducing PM10 emissions for car brakes by 50%, [Perricone et al (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164817300960)
* Intro
    * In countries in the European Union, the mass PM<sub>10</sub> of brake emissions equals approximately 8–27% of the total traffic-related emissions.
    * Considering the stricter WHO AQG values, the fraction of population affected changes to 50% and 85% respectively for PM10 and PM2.5
    * During the braking event, the friction pair wear out generating particles: the airborne fraction can penetrate the human body in many ways, including contact with the skin, breathing, and eating with potential adverse health effects
    * Whilst exhaust gases from road transport are monitored and regulated by European legislation, little interest has been shown so far in PM originating from the wear of brakes, tyres and other non-exhaust emissions that altogether may amount to 50% by mass of the total ones [3], [4] and its relative contribution is expected to increase due to the legislation driven reduction of aerosols from vehicle combustion processes [5].
    * According to recent investigations [6], 16–55% by mass of non-exhaust emissions are generated by brake wear, and it was estimated that 50% of the brake wear particles become airborne, 80–98% of which are in the PM10 range [7], [8]. Therefore, the reduction of airborne particles required to meet the EU objectives [9] could comprise a reduction in emissions from automobile brake wear.


* Discussion
    * One of the main goals of the REBRAKE project was the demonstration of the possibility of reducing PM10 emissions from automotive disc brakes by at least 50 wt%.
    * if emissions from disc brake systems were reduced by 50 wt% on vehicles circulating in Europe, this would reduce the overall PM10 emissions from road traffic by 4–14%. In the REBRAKE project, the results demonstrate that it is possible to design a brake system that can reduce PM10 emissions by up to 65 wt%. This result has been achieved
    * A more effective approach to further reduce emissions from car brake systems should rely on a holistic approach in which the search for innovative materials, i.e., friction materials, disc treatments and disc coatings, is certainly an important prerequisite to reduce emissions without jeopardizing the effective braking action.
