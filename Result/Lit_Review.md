## Non-Exhaust Road Emission and Health
Many studies associating air pollution with health have conducted research in the urban environment that includes commercial areas, traffic junctions. These areas are highly correlated to traffic volumes as the pollution monitors observe substantial increase of PM10, PM2.5, NO2, and O3 during busy hours. As many studies prove that PM10 associates with increasing weight of traffic (*cite*), which in turn affects the number of risk of death.


Although traffic-related pollution has caused an detrimental impact on health due to its toxicity and its size that can easily penetrate into their metabolism, it is still unclear how much contribution the exhaust particles has made on human health compared to non-exhaust particles (Amato, 2018). So far, a large body of the literature has focused on the exhaust emission (CITE) and dispersion, which was visible enough to identify the impact. With this effort, many countries and cities now have
