## Non-Exhaust Road Emission and Health

### A concept for reducing PM10 emissions for car brakes by 50%, [Perricone et al (2017)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043164817300960)
* Intro
    * In countries in the European Union, the mass PM<sub>10</sub> of brake emissions equals approximately 8–27% of the total traffic-related emissions.
    * Considering the stricter WHO AQG values, the fraction of population affected changes to 50% and 85% respectively for PM10 and PM2.5
    * During the braking event, the friction pair wear out generating particles: the airborne fraction can penetrate the human body in many ways, including contact with the skin, breathing, and eating with potential adverse health effects
    * Whilst exhaust gases from road transport are monitored and regulated by European legislation, little interest has been shown so far in PM originating from the wear of brakes, tyres and other non-exhaust emissions that altogether may amount to 50% by mass of the total ones [3], [4] and its relative contribution is expected to increase due to the legislation driven reduction of aerosols from vehicle combustion processes [5].
    * According to recent investigations [6], 16–55% by mass of non-exhaust emissions are generated by brake wear, and it was estimated that 50% of the brake wear particles become airborne, 80–98% of which are in the PM10 range [7], [8]. Therefore, the reduction of airborne particles required to meet the EU objectives [9] could comprise a reduction in emissions from automobile brake wear.


* Discussion
    * One of the main goals of the REBRAKE project was the demonstration of the possibility of reducing PM10 emissions from automotive disc brakes by at least 50 wt%.
    * if emissions from disc brake systems were reduced by 50 wt% on vehicles circulating in Europe, this would reduce the overall PM10 emissions from road traffic by 4–14%. In the REBRAKE project, the results demonstrate that it is possible to design a brake system that can reduce PM10 emissions by up to 65 wt%. This result has been achieved
    * A more effective approach to further reduce emissions from car brake systems should rely on a holistic approach in which the search for innovative materials, i.e., friction materials, disc treatments and disc coatings, is certainly an important prerequisite to reduce emissions without jeopardizing the effective braking action.

* Intro
    - Road transport emissions account for a significant share of this burden. While important technological improvements have been made for reducing particulate matter (PM) emissions from motor exhausts, no actions are currently in place to reduce the non-exhaust part of emissions such as those from brake wear, road wear, tyre wear and road dust resuspension.
    - “non-exhaust” sources contribute easily as much and often more than the tailpipe exhaust to the ambient air PM concentrations in cities, and their relative contribution to ambient PM is destined to increase in the future, posing obvious research and policy challenges.

* Health effects
    - Particle mass, size and (surface) chemistry all affect PM toxicity. One of the biological mechanisms causing toxicity is oxidative stress which is often related to transition metals and/or redox active organics such as quinone
    - Brake and tyre wear particles have higher oxidative potential than other traffic-related sources and their effect is very local (50–100 m from the source) yielding more oxidant PM (per μg/m3) at road sites rather than at urban background sites. 
    - Tyre wear particles have been shown to induce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) formation and inflammatory reaction in human alveolar cells, as well as inflammatory response in mouse lungs
    - Gustafsson et al. [18] showed at least as high inflammatory potential from road wear PM10 compared to diesel engine exhaust particles. Brake wear particles damage have been linked to oxidative stress and inflammatory responses in the lung using incubations of lung cells with brake wear particles
    - Epidemiological studies related specifically to non-exhaust sources are still very few, again due to the difficult task of obtaining long time series of specific tracers and the lack of personal exposure data for risk assessment studies.


* Measurements and source contributions
    - Ambient air measurements across Europe have revealed a total non-exhaust contribution (wear emissions + resuspension) to PM10 comparable to that of tailpipe emissions, with a clear exacerbation in Scandinavian and Mediterranean countries due to winter tyres and drier climate, respectively
    - Ketzel et al. estimated that in several European countries a large part (about 50–85% depending on the location) of the total traffic PM10 emissions originates from non-exhaust sources. 
    - In Southern Spain for example, from 2004 to 2011 road dust contributions to PM10 levels measured at a number of sites did not decrease, while motor exhaust contributions decreased (p < 0.001) by 0.4 (0.57–0.24) μg m−3 year−1
    - Further research is necessary to better separate individual contributions from road dust resuspension, brake, tyre and road wear given that the relative toxicity and mitigation measures are different.
    - Generally resuspension seems dominant in terms of mass, although its contribution can vary widely across Europe since road humidity dominates the emission potential: ∼12% of PM10 in UK, 20–35% in Spain and Greece, up to 90% in Scandinavian countries during late winter and spring when studded tyres and road sanding contribute
    - Tyre wear generally contributes the least of the non-exhaust sources (10% at Marylebone Road in London) with a mean contribution to PM10 always below 2% 
    - Road wear contribution estimates are more common in Scandinavian countries where studded tyres generate high abrasion and airborne mineral dust is dominated by road wear particle suspension [35], but road wear can be substantial also where studded tyres are not used, due to low quality pavement material and constructions
    - The contribution of road sanding and deposited Saharan dust are difficult to separate from that of pavement wear due to comparable chemical composition, as well as the interaction (sand wearing pavement) and its variation in time and space.


* Mitigation and Policy
    - The optimal mitigation techniques and strategies needed to abate PM non-exhaust emissions from road traffic are still an open question. 
    - The possible strategies to reduce non-exhaust emissions can be categorized as those aimed at minimizing the sources by 
    - (i) improving wear properties of materials  
    - (ii) reducing the wear potential of traffic (e.g. studded tyres)
    - those aimed at minimizing suspension to air by (i) removing/immobilizing dust from road surface (road cleaning), (ii) binding dust to road surface and 
    - (iii) adjusting traffic (less traffic, lower speed, less heavy vehicles). The optimum strategy likely involves a combination of the three categories.
    - Although more research is needed, recent studies suggest that beside the wear resistance of rock materials used for road pavement [63], [64], other factors can reduce road wear emission potential: larger stone size, lower texture depth, road pavement construction type (e.g. rubber mixed asphalt, porous asphalt) and good operation and maintenance
    - The lack of research focusing on preventive measures has directed interest towards mitigating measures, aimed at minimizing suspension to air. Road cleaning activities were found to reduce road dust resuspension only when water was used, due to the increase of road moisture content (rather than actual removal of dust). However, **road washing activities were more effective in drier climates such as the Mediterranean region (up to 10% of daily PM10) while vacuum-sweeping alone did not provide evidence of effectiveness in the short-term**

* Intro
    * Regulatory programmes aimed at reducing air pollution from road traffic have exclusively focused on tailpipe exhaust emissions. However, it has been shown that the contribution of non-exhaust primary particles to the total traffic generated airborne particulate material is significant in urban areas
    * Denier van der Gon et al. (2013) found that the proportion between non-exhaust and exhaust particles strongly increased in the last two decades due to the successful implementation of exhaust emission control technologies and improvement of fuel quality.
    * Lawrence et al. (2013) combined motorway tunnel sampling and source apportionment modelling. The application of principal component analysis and multiple linear regression analysis enabled to identify the emission sources for 82% of the total PM10 mass inside the tunnel.
    * Weinbruch et al. (2014) quantified the contribution of the three traffic-related components (exhaust, abrasion, and resuspension) to curbside and urban background PM10 and PM1 levels in the urban/industrial Ruhr area (Germany), based on the analysis of individual particles by scanning electron microscopy. The total contribution of traffic to PM10 was estimated to be 27% at the urban background station and 48% at the curbside station.

## Traffic-ABM and Health
### Agent-based modelling to estimate exposures to urban air pollution from transportation: Exposure disparities and impacts of high-resolution data: [Guram et al 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019897151830156X#f0015)

* In this study, we developed and used an exposure modeling framework that integrates an activity-based travel demand simulator (DaySim), a dynamic traffic assignment model (MATSim), a mobile-source emissions estimator (MOVES), and a dispersion model (R-LINE) to estimate disaggregate and subgroup exposures to NOx from passenger car emissions in the Tampa area for an average winter day in 2010. 
* The authors give a stepwise approach which firstly employs DaySim to model individual activity and merges MATSim that implements automobile journeys when planned. NOx is emitted and dispersed during the journey by MOVES and R-LINE toolkits
* The model was simulated for a day between 3:00 am to 2:59 am with a temporal resolution of 1 min on a typical weekday
* DaySim activity-based travel-demand model system comprises a suite of econometric models
* DaySim requires input data on individual-level demographic characteristics that are representative of the study area population, parcel-level land-use information, and transportation system characteristics. 
* DaySim does not model their travel routes/paths between different activity locations. ⇒ covered by MATSim
* MATSim updates and optimizes the agents' daily schedules (i.e., their plans) to generate travel routes subject to the network capacity and travel time constraints. Therefore, in every iteration of the constrained optimization process, MATSim selects a plan from a short list of competing plans stored in memory, executes it, and then calculates a utility score for the plan
* MOVES requires information on vehicle activity (traffic volumes and speeds), along with the vehicle fleet mix, fuels used, roadway characteristics, and area weather. In our framework, MOVES is applied at the project level in batch mode using the link-specific vehicle activity data output from MATSim (and input roadway characteristics) to estimate emissions (in grams) from individual roadway links for each hour of the day.
* The exposure modeling component of our framework involves combining the spatiotemporal locations of simulated individuals with the spatiotemporal distributions of pollutant concentration to estimate measures of person-level exposure. The output from MATSim contains a sequential activity-record for each individual.
* Specifically, the daily activity-based exposure for each individual in the study sample is calculated as E = ∑cσΔtσ, with cσ and Δtσ representing the ambient concentration and the time spent at each spatiotemporal location of discretized activity and travel, σ (e.g. latitude, longitude, time of day). A daily exposure concentration, C, for each individual is also calculated by dividing exposure (E) by the averaging period (24 h).
* The mean daily exposure found here is somewhat lower than the earlier study, but the maximum exposure is substantially higher. Hence, large-scale agent-based modeling approaches that employ high-resolution activity-based exposure estimation may have value for capturing the high-end exposures that could otherwise be missed. 
* During off-work hours, higher exposures were concentrated in the residential pockets between the university area and I-275, along I-275, and near downtown. During the morning commute (~5:00–8:00 am), the high exposure areas shifted from the residential pockets and spread out across the urban core of Tampa, especially along major highways and suburban areas. During work hours (~8:00 am until 5:00 pm), the spatial distribution remained fairly constant and the downtown area had the highest exposure densities. During the evening commute (~5:00–7:00 pm), high exposure densities spread across the urban core of Tampa and its suburbs, although levels were more diffuse than during the morning commute.
* Impact of the resolution of data on exposure estimates. 
    * Use of both low-resolution activity and low-resolution concentration data (i.e. activities and concentrations at block-group centroids with travel time assigned equally to the origin and destination block groups) led to 10% lower mean exposure (positive overall error, ε) than using high-resolution data, suggesting underestimation on average.
    * Exposure error distributions only varied substantially from this population-level error distribution for the daily travel time categories.
    * Moreover, we found that use of low-resolution data modified the relative rank of group-level mean exposures (not shown). Specifically, low-resolution data led to higher mean exposure for medium travellers (31–60 min per day) than for heavy travellers (>60 min.), rather than the reverse.
    * Conversely, the below poverty and middle-income groups had disproportionately high exposures at all exposure levels. For the below-poverty group a steep increase in disparity is also observed at the highest exposure levels.
    * Concerning racial and ethnic categories, subgroup mean exposure was higher than the population mean for blacks (higher by 6%), Hispanics (4%), Asians (2%), and other races (2%). Conversely, it was slightly lower (by 2%) than the population mean for whites and non-Hispanics. 
    * Overall, exposures to passenger car emissions were higher for individuals residing in urban zones and with higher daily travel times. Exposures were also higher for the lower-to-middle-income households, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, and people of working ages (19–65).
    * individuals from below poverty and middle-income households, children (aged 0–18), and adults over 65 years had slightly smaller exposure errors compared to the population, suggesting a lower propensity for underestimation of exposures on average.


* Limitations
    * First, Study area. 1 day modelling period
    * Second, the study only included activities of residents within the transportation modeling domain to characterize the traffic-related air pollution. Impacts due to activities of non-residents who visit or travel through the region are not considered
    * Third, we only simulated the automobile travel mode. Hence the exposures of individuals and groups who choose other modes (transit, biking, walking) is not well represented.
    * Finally, as in any large-scale and multi-domain modeling study, uncertainties of model outcomes ought to be considered when interpreting the results. 

* Conclusion
    * Although simulated NOx concentrations were generally low, concentrations at a few near-roadway locations were high enough to be a potential concern for human health. 
    * Additionally, our results confirmed the persistence of disparities in exposure to traffic-related air pollution between population subgroups in the study area. 
    * Finally, the resolution of data on activity, travel, and concentration was found to be important to the accuracy of exposure estimation; use of low-resolution data, particularly concentration data, may lead to underestimation of exposures on average (and both under- and overestimation of exposures for individuals). 
    * Hence this study adds to the body of literature demonstrating the usefulness of transportation modeling for estimating individual-level population exposure at high resolution.
    * Further, the framework presented here provides a helpful tool for continued investigation of the impacts of potential urban design scenarios on exposures to traffic-related air pollution and their distribution among the population.

* Intro: Dynamics of Environment Exposure
    * human exposure to the urban environment is strongly linked to various processes that are inherent in human mobility, distinctly local and individual characteristics (e.g., clothing type, traveling tool, physical quality) and finally, to the quality of the natural, built, and social environment.

* Modeling Approaches for Assessing Environment Exposures
    * Schnell et al. [24] criticized such models: (1) they underestimate concentrations of risk factors using limited monitoring measurements; (2) the complexity of pollutant distribution patterns was hardly accurate in these models; and (3) the indoor environment was ignored when using only outdoor monitoring data. Beyond Schnell’s criticism, these models mostly focus on a single stressor of concern, and describe a few pathways through which the receptor—either a human or another organism—can be exposed
