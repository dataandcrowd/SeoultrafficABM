## How do people commute to their destinations?
Using the mode-based OD matrix (2015), this study investigated how people travelled to the CBD by different transport modes. 

### Summary
* Daily inflow
    * Outside CBD -> CBD: over 30% used subways, around 20% took buses(all types), and 15% used passenger cars
    * CBD -> CBD: 32% were pedestrians, 25% were buses, and 20% were subways
    * Within subdistrict: over 50% were pedestrians
* Daily outflow: similar to the inflow


### Data Source
KTDB provides 15 modes that include:
walking, passenger car, carpooled people, city bus, regional bus, town bus, intercity bus, express bus, other buses, subway, rail, speed rail, taxi, small freight, large freight, motorbike, bicycle, and other modes. 

The 2015 database provides three type of OD matrix based on weekdays, which are morning rush hours (07-09 hours), evening rush hours (18-20 hours), and a daily aggregate.

The database also estimates passengers per vehicle type and distance. Seoul, for example, will apply 1.42 persons for passenger cars travelling inside the city and 1.33 persons heading outside; each taxi has 1.47 persons; each city bus has 19.27 persons, intercity bus with 13.48 persons, and regional bus with 19.02 persons.

Each row gives an origin and destination areas based on the admin codes and all the modes as an approximated number. For example, passenger cars from Sajik to Sajik will have 539.008 persons travelling per day.

### Daily OD: Inflow
This section separated the inflows to three categories: 1) Coming from the outside region, 2) Travelling within the CBD, 3) Travelling within the subdistrict.

* From the outside
People travelling from outside normally uses the subway system (749165 persons, 34.4%), buses (all types, 469691 persons, 21.6%), their own vehicles (367723 persons, 16.9%), or taxis (235903, 10.8%). Seoul CBD has a great subway connection with 6 lines and three national railways, which allows commuters to prefer over the other transport. Long-distant buses heading directly in front of the business areas and town buses connect from subway exits to the business zones are likewise preferred.

Pedestrians who walk to *Sogong* were more likely to have used the train station. Even for a short distance, people tended to use buses, subways and taxis to save time.

* Moving inside the CBD
During the nighttime, people tend to walk more than use other transport but the areas their origin is biased to places near the train station. The city bus and subways are evenly used from these districts.

* Travelling within the subdistrict
Not many people use the transport system but to walk. Still, for some places buses are favoured for the sake of saving time and effort to walk up in the hilly areas.

### Morning rush hours: which transport do they use to get here?
Morning rush hours, 7-9am, are meant to be the busiest hours of the day. In vein with the daily matrix, subways are usually preferred during the morning rush hours but proportion of the passenger cars have dropped to 9.4% compared to the daily statistics at 16.9%.

A noticeable difference travelling inside CBD is that most people take transports to their destination. This might be due to the office start hours or as a connection to other modes of transport.
